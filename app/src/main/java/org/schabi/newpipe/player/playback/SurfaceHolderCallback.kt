/**
 * Prevent error message: 'Unrecoverable player error occurred'
 * In case of rotation some users see this kind of an error which is preventable
 * having a Callback that handles the lifecycle of the surface.
 *
 *
 * How?: In case we are no longer able to write to the surface eg. through rotation/putting in
 * background we set set a DummySurface. Although it it works on API >= 23 only.
 * Result: we get a little video interruption (audio is still fine) but we won't get the
 * 'Unrecoverable player error occurred' error message.
 *
 *
 * This implementation is based on:
 * 'ExoPlayer stuck in buffering after re-adding the surface view a few time #2703'
 *
 *
 * -> exoplayer fix suggestion link
 * https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2703#issuecomment-300599981
